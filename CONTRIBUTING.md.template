# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to contribute!

## First-Time Contributors

We use an approval gate for new contributors:

1. **Open an issue** describing what you want to change and why
2. Keep it concise and write in your own voice
3. A maintainer will comment `lgtm` if approved
4. Once approved, you can submit PRs

This exists to ensure quality contributions and avoid wasted effort on both sides.

## Submitting a PR

Once you're approved:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch for your changes
3. Make your changes
4. Submit a PR
